/**
 * Readiness engine — roadmap/13-scheduler-packets-context.md §In scope,
 * "DAG executor": "readiness = dependencies + lease + overlap analysis
 * (07) + non-Git resource serialization; default one worker." This module
 * is the PURE decision function; leasing itself is `@crabgic/journal`'s `Lease`
 * (consumed, never reimplemented here — see `../executor.ts`), and overlap
 * analysis is `@crabgic/git-engine`'s `analyzeOverlap` (also consumed, never
 * reimplemented).
 *
 * A `WorkUnit` is READY iff:
 *  - its own `attemptStatus` is `pending` (not already dispatched/
 *    terminal/parked);
 *  - every `dependsOn` id has `attemptStatus === "succeeded"`;
 *  - it does not collide (per the supplied `CollisionVerdict`s) with any
 *    unit CURRENTLY in flight (`inFlightUnitIds`) — "overlapping units are
 *    serialized" (roadmap/13 §In scope).
